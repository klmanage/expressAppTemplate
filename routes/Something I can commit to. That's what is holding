It's a simple formula: There is always something in front of you that is wanting to be done. You simply do that thing. That's all there is to it.

Except that you understand that you bring *everything* you have to the act of doing. You don't think: this is trivial, this is less than serious or this is a lesser task. Because you only have now and it's always you that is there in that thing. That thing only exists in you and only now. Once that thing is done it's a new now a new instance of you and some thing that wants to be done.

Someone asked the question "what does drawing want?". This apparent reversal of subjectivity is marginally interesting, it smacks of psychologism and is therefor not trustworthy (the priviledged position of the observer..) but there is some truth in there somewhere. There is the possibility of thinking beyond the subjection that we feel - the "I have to do this.."

I've long had problems with the 'have to's' but the counter idea that really it is just *your decision* or that *you don't have to. You just want to* etc doesn't actually feel sufficient. There is something in the expression that is the wrong way around. It's a habit of speech or something. The feeling is of obligation of unwanted demand - we really want to be doing something else. But it turns out, usually, that this something else we'd rather be doing is not of the same order. It's imaginary. It's a doing which has some imaginary value attached. This other thing is somehow 'better'. As though we have a way of measuring such a difference for something that has not yet happened against something immanent.

As an idea washing up and other 'menial' tasks are unappealing because they have no obvious value beyond the necessity of clean plates, getting rid of germs etc. They are purely utilitarian. Or this is how our imagination works. It's not known that such tasks actually *do anything* beneath the covers in quite the same way that we imagine 'Painting' or 'writing' and such like.

But do we think that Reading is really a doing? Especially when we appear to be simply reading to no known purpose. Entertainment, pleasure. If we read with intent: we are trying to understand something, we read in a way which is very unlike the imagined idea of reading. There is so much complexity in what occurs it's impossible to go into. But, it's this difference between what we 'project' into something not yet done against the 'known' 'challenge' of doing some thing that stands before you.

Mechanically, it is *easy* to do most things. But, emotionally, we are convinced that things have different values. Or rather that 'doings' have different values in-themselves. Different orders of magnitude. There is, for example, no gainsaying the value of certain activities. There is no order in which they can be 'bad'. There is no gainsaying the badness of 'cleaning' either. But, from another point of view, all we will ever do in life is 'doing' of one form or another and the idea that when we do *this* thing we are fully engaged yet when we do that thing we are not, seems a little strange. It is as if we cannot *afford* to be fully engaged at all times?

Energy. Maybe there is a correlation between the amount of available energy and the way it is used up. But, what about that which is energising that which puts energy back into the system.

there is no doubt that deep thought uses lots of power and that it is impossible to sustain for long periods. Equally there is no doubt that some things allow our minds to wander even whilst we do them, or listen to a radio show. But, observation shows that in these cases we often make mistakes as our attention is divided amongst many tasks.

At other times, say when we are asleep, it feels as though we have been doing some processing of some thing that occupied us during the day even though we have been *sleeping*, i.e. doing something else.

The argument quickly descends into one of cognition. That is concentration. It is hard to see concentration but you can sometimes hear it. It's the sound of silence or of the abilility to *ignore* noise. When you are deep in concentration you literally stop noticing all distractions below a certain level. If something dramatic happens you will be interrupted. But otherwise you can easily ignore normal 'noise'. But, is 'ignoring' not already a doing? Is that not what concentration requires, the act of ignoring? Isn't forgetting a similar activity. Forgetting in order to write or speak or what ever. Like trying to hear something for the first time again.

So, some jobs have no identity as such buy you need to do them in order to enter into 'doing'. to do this requires a minimal *excuse*. Because otherwise 'duty', 'obligation', 'responsibility' raise their ugly heads and suddenly they are 'have to's'.

It's a question of coming to terms with this. To evaluate each and every instance of doing would be exhausting and everything would take longer and require more energy. In a system where there is a heirarchy of things to do this would result in constant failure.

We talk about setting aside time. Setting aside an amount of time to do some thing. This is very common. Failing to be abel to do this is seen as a real weakness. We talk about people who are able to get things done. This is also very common and regarded as a great quality to have. Yet it is uncertain how we arrive at this judgement. Getting things done seems to be a processual idea that assumes that there are things to be done that these things are in some way necessary that they may be obstacles.

So we may better say that this person is good at overcoming obstacles. Or that they are able to find sufficient reason and sufficient desire to meet obstacles on their own terms and overcome them.

Overcoming. It's an odd concept. What is being overcome? Is it really the thing that needs doing? Or is it our own inertia - our own lack of desire to do them?

On what basis does a thing that must be done present us with this problem of not wanting to do it? It's nice when someone brings you tea in bed. It's nice when you return to find that dinner has been prepared. In other words maybe it has to do with 'giving' and 'receiving'. Receiving, getting the benefit has the notion that we did not have to expend. We have received something without expending. Giving is different. Giving fills us with a sense of worth. As the giver we 'know' that we are providing the feeling of receiving to someone else. It's generosity.

This becomes problematic when we try to systematise it. Whe we 'employ' people to do the lesser works. We deny them the 'giving' because we pay them to do it. At the same time we deny ourselves the feeling of 'generosity' because we are not giving. Now that we are paying we have rights. Now that I am being payed I have rights. Now we are dealing with laws!

There are many necessary actions that have to be taken to support life. Eating drinking etc. We constantly overdetermine these things when we treat them as 'things that have to be done'. When we take food to the limit. When we go beyond need and into expression. When we in effect pollute giving with a self. Making a meal is not just preparing food to be eaten. Now, it's a social and political gesture. I make food like this. I love the way you have done that. Like it is some work of art, some extraordinary thing.

This is the social at work. The fractured self constantly trying to recombine itself. Trying to put a set of values together into a coherent whole.

In writing this have I not wasted 'X' amount of time and energy? Was it needed by anyone? Does it have a 'value' that can be recognised and inserted in to the scale of values. People have their own scales of values. Not that they are fixed. But at any one time it is inevitable that peoples scales of values will be oriented by their own particular development in experience.

Those who have experienced the 'beyond' will know something unknown to those who remained within their same milieu. If you have eaten raw fish in Japan - and therefore come to 'understand' it - you will not be capable of being repulsed by the 'idea' of eating raw fish that others, without that experience, will feel.

Such wide experience of the world is available only to a few. The vast majority never leave the 'world' they were born in. They are said to be small minded or narrow minded or uneducated or inexperienced.

In fact we are all each of these things. The scale is always written on the back of an envelope it always consists of the same number of values, just the range of values changes. And what the envelope shows is that noone experiences any *more* than anyone else. We all have the same amount of time. Some have a much richer experience of narrow concerns than others etc.
Some have gone deep on a small range of things and shallow on others. I don't know how to make a curry from scratch. I don't have a concept of curry. I can do other things but being relatively 'esoteric' they cannot be compared on that scale. So in a room full of 'curry lovers' I have nothing in common.

thats it for now.


Something I can commit to. That's what is holding me back. I want something I can commit to and I don't know what that is. But, I know I don't want something that I have no belief in.
I don't want to teach computing or programming. I need to teach at a different level - not school children. I don't want to have to watch my P's and Q's and I don't want to have to put up with too much mediocrity. As long as I can avoid the usual crap I'll be happy. The thing is it has to be something I actually care about. Otherwise, the first sign of trouble and I will want to be out of there. Also, I don't want to sign up for lifer

Doing things that change things as immediately as possible. Just little things - or rather the things that we often think of as little or inconsequential - flattening the heirarchy of things and tasks. It's all I can actually do at the moment - and this may always be the way - so be it.

This way does work-to a degree. It also means there is no optimisation, none of the usual planning or multitasking or doing things as quickly as possible.

Under the circumstances this is more natural. We're dealing with a special kind of mess. It's just a case of doing whatever presents itself. You want to paint a wall? Then you have to move some stuff. Now that you have moved that stuff you need to do something with it. But, it's possibly useless stuff - I can't decide! So, I leave it until I can decide. Eventually, the moment to decide comes along quite naturally because you need to do some other thing and the crap is in the way. And so on and so forth.

This way I'm rarely disappointed. I know its not going to be great until there is less of this mess to deal with. But, its a lot better than working it all out in advance and getting overwhelmed by the sheer scale of it.

What makes it easier is that you are under no other pressure than what you want to do next. I've got only one guiding principle: make the place a way that I can live in it without being dragged down. It just has to be practical and basically right. I don't just let things go. If it's wrong I try to fix it. As if I'm doing it for the last time. I don't aim to keep doing this over and over.

It's surprising what turns out to be 'right' and 'wrong' by this measure. The printer shouldn't be in the living room. I don't want that interrupting me all the time!

So, now I need to find a place for it that is not quite so wrong.

Making things less 'wrong' or more 'right' depending on your point of view.
